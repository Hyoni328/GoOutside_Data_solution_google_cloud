# GoOutside_Data_transformation_project

## Project Overview
This project was run in August 2024 as part of the WBS CODING SCHOOL Data Analytics Bootcamp.

GoOutside, a leading adventure and camping gear supplier, is in urgent need of a data overhaul. 
After their Data Analyst quit unexpectedly, they were left with a chaotic and inaccessible data storage system. 
This project aims to implement a robust, scalable, and user-friendly data solution using Googleâ€™s suite of data tools: BigQuery, Sheets, and Looker Studio.


## Goal
1. **Create a Data Warehouse**: Utilize BigQuery to establish a secure and organized data warehouse for all customer information, product details, and sales history.
2. **User-Friendly Spreadsheets**: Develop intuitive spreadsheets in Google Sheets to ensure that non-technical team members can easily access and understand the data.
3. **Interactive Dashboards**: Design a visually compelling dashboard in Looker Studio to provide the CEO and other stakeholders with actionable insights.

## Tools
- **Google BigQuery**: For creating and managing the data warehouse.
- **Google Sheets**: For developing user-friendly spreadsheets.
- **Looker Studio**: For building interactive and insightful dashboards.
